# Ethan Rugh's Portfolio

## A site containing all of the projects I have worked on so far, to be updated periodically as more projects are completed. Nothing too fancy, but everything works, which is honestly better than I'd hoped it would turn out. This challenge forced me to take to the internet for answers to my specific coding questions. Answers, I found, and a new tool as well. I better understand now what to ask in order to find the answers. Thanks for your consideration, happy coding.

##
Built using
    - CSS
