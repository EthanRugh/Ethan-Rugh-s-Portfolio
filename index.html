                    Hey, I'm Ethan. Native Texan with experience in a 
                    wide variety of career fields including land 
                    surveying, household appliance delivery and 
                    installation, and oilfield 811 operation! 
                    You're probably wondering "Huh? I thought this 
                    guy was a coder?". Allow me to explain myself. 
                    They say "Jack of all trades, master of none", 
                    well I say "better of one than of none". 
                    Which is why I decided to enroll in UTSA's 
                    Coding Bootcamp! Though I still have much to 
                    learn, I've learned so much already! So far, 
                    we've covered HTML, CSS, and Java Script, with 
                    much, much more on the horizon. Below, you'll 
                    find examples of some of the sites I've been 
                    building through the bootcamp, as well as my 
                    resume. Thanks for checking me out!
